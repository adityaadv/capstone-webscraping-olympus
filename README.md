# capstone-webscraping-olympus
capstone project for data analytics with python

This notebook contains the capstone project of Webscraping by using one of the Python libraries called `beautifulSoup4` and created by Aditya Adhrevi

**BACKGROUND**

This project is due to one of the requirements in passing Data Analytics with Python courses of Fullstack Data Science program by [Algorit.ma](https://algorit.ma/). Within this project, a web scrapping approach is used to extract data from a website. The website that is used is [IMDB](imdb.com/search/title/?release_date=2019-01-01,2019-12-31) and the data to be extracted are movies from year 2019 with the limitation of 5 web pages. 

**Dependencies:**

- beautifulSoup4
- pandas
- flask
- matplotlib

In summary, web scrapping is a powerful tool to gather data within a webpage (or multiple) that could help to provide data that are accessible through web. This project also demonstrates the data wrangling and visualization process which is also required for exploring the data source at the beginning.
